# Contributor Credits - Ethereum Smart Contract

A Contributor Credit (C²) is way to pay your collaborators before you have money or even a business.

Each Contributor Credit, written "C²", is a promise to pay $1 the future, when the project or business reaches a "trigger," such as a round of investment or a revenue target, that you set in advance. If an entrepreneur pays 300 C² with a trigger of $1,000,000 in investment, then she must pay the holder of those C² $300 when her project raises $1,000,000 or more. If the business never reaches the trigger, then it doesn't have to pay.
